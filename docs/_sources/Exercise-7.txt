Exercise 7
==========

In exercise 7 we will work with a piece of the `Global Forest Change Dataset <http://earthenginepartners.appspot.com/science-2013-global-forest>`_ by Hansen et al (2013).
The goal of the exercise is to delineate forest areas from an area of interest by processing raster layers containing information about canopy cover in 2000.

You should be able to complete the exercise by altering the simple tools presented during this lesson.
