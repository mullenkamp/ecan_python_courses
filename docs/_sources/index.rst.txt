Welcome to Python Courses for ECan Staff
===========================================

These Python courses will teach you various Python skills helpful to ECan staff that need to do data processing and analysis. These range from Python fundamentals, extracting data, data manipulations, scripting, GIS spatial processing, and more. Each course/lesson is a tutorial to learn specific Python topic(s). Certain parts of the course will use ECan internal datasets and databases, while others will use publically available datasets.

Credits
--------

The structure of these courses/lessons are modeled after a series of great online courses written by Henrikki Tenkanen at the University of Helsinki. Additionally, the relevant content from the Helsinki courses will be used in our courses. 

These courses include:

 * `Python for geo-people <https://github.com/Python-for-geo-people/Course-information>`_
 * `Automating GIS processes <https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/2016/>`_
 * `Introduction to Quantitative Geology  <https://github.com/Intro-Quantitative-Geology/Course-information>`_

Course format
-------------

The majority of this course will be spent in front of a computer learning to program in the Python language and working on exercises.

The computer exercises will focus on developing basic programming skills using the Python language and applying those skills to associated problems.
Typical exercises will involve a brief introduction followed by topical computer-based tasks. At the end of the exercises, you may be asked to submit answers
to relevant questions, some related plots, and/or Python codes you have written or used. You are encouraged to discuss and work together with other students
on the laboratory exercises, however the laboratory summary write-ups that you submit must be completed individually and must clearly reflect your own work.

.. admonition:: Open Access!

    The course is **open for everyone**. The aim of this course is to share the knowledge and help people at ECan to get started with their journey with Python.

.. admonition:: Step by step instructions with RDS!

    The materials are written in a way that you can follow them step by step exactly as they are written, as long as you use the RDSProd03 internal server setup that contains all of the Python goodies.
    If you work from your own computer, **you will need to install the necessary software and adjust the file paths to the data** accordingly.

.. admonition:: For teachers

    If you would like to use these materials for your own teaching or develop them further, we highly support that.
    Please read more about how to do it from `here <License-terms.html>`_.
