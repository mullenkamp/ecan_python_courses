Python in ArcGIS
================

arcpy
-----

Arcpy is a Python module that provides access to ArcGIS geoprocessing tools as well as additional functions, classes, and modules that allow you to create simple or
complex workflows quickly and easily. **Arcpy comes only with ArcGIS software**, thus it cannot be downloaded freely from anywhere. The following materials are based on ArcGIS 10.3 -version.

Using arcpy
-----------

There are two different ways of using Python and the arcpy -module in ArcGIS:

 1. **Using the Python console** in ArcGIS which you can access by using the menus (Geoprocessing --> Python), or by pushing the dedicated Python button:

 2. **Using the Python IDLE (IDE)** that comes with ArcGIS (All programs --> ArcGIS --> Python 2.7 --> IDLE (Python GUI) ).

Even though ArcGIS provides its own Python console with nice Syntax infobar, it is more practical and recommendable to write your code using Python IDLE bundled
in ArcGIS because you cannot save your code easily using Python console in ArcGIS. ArcGIS Python console is, however,
good for testing how specific geoprocessing functions of arcpy work.

Good thing to understand is that **the Python console within ArcGIS Desktop is the same thing as Python IDLE of ArcGIS** that can be found under All Programs in Windows:
