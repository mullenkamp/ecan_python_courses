    "*Following materials are partly based on documentation of [Geopandas](http://geopandas.org/geocoding.html), [geopy](http://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/1.11.0/#) and [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)\n",

    "## Overview of Geocoders\n",
    "\n",
    "Geocoding, i.e. converting addresses into coordinates or vice versa, is a really common GIS task. Luckily, in Python there are nice libraries that makes the geocoding really easy. One of the libraries that can do the geocoding for us is [geopy](http://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/1.11.0/) that makes it easy to locate the coordinates of addresses, cities, countries, and landmarks across the globe using third-party geocoders and other data sources. \n",
    "\n",
    "As said, **Geopy** uses third-party geocoders - i.e. services that does the geocoding - to locate the addresses and it works with multiple different service providers such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ESRI ArcGIS](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/)\n",
    "- [Baidu Maps](http://developer.baidu.com/map/webservice-geocoding.htm)\n",
    "- [Bing](http://www.microsoft.com/maps/developers/web.aspx)\n",
    "- [geocoder.us](http://geocoder.us/)\n",
    "- [GeocodeFarm](https://www.geocodefarm.com/)\n",
    "- [GeoNames](http://www.geonames.org/)\n",
    "- [Google Geocoding API (V3)](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/)\n",
    "- [IGN France](http://api.ign.fr/tech-docs-js/fr/developpeur/search.html)\n",
    "- [Mapquest](http://www.mapquestapi.com/geocoding/)\n",
    "- [Mapzen Search](https://mapzen.com/projects/search/)\n",

    "\n",
    "Thus, there is plenty of geocoders where to choose from! However, to be able to use these services you might need to request so called API access-keys from the service provider to be able to use the service. You can get your access keys to e.g. Google Geocoding API from [Google APIs console](https://code.google.com/apis/console) by creating a Project and enabling a that API from [Library](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library). Read a short introduction about using Google API Console from [here](https://developers.googleblog.com/2016/03/introducing-google-api-console.html).\n",

    "*There are also other Python modules in addition to geopy that can do geocoding such as* [Geocoder](http://geocoder.readthedocs.io/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Geocoding in Geopandas\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to do geocoding in Geopandas using its integrated functionalities of geopy. Geopandas has a function called `geocode()` that can geocode a list of addresses (strings) and return a GeoDataFrame containing the resulting point objects in `geometry` column. Nice, isn't it! Let's try this out. \n",
